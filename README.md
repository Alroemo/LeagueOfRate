League of Rate

A Python 2.7 Program that uses the Riot API to calculate the most efficent champion spell
The program imports the Riot API using json, pip, and request to pull the static data of champions.
It calculates the score of each champion based their base Attack damage, attack range, and MP and each spell stats of AP effect, cooldown, and cost.

To Run:
Since Riot does not allow developers to share API keys, you will need to add your own key to the program in order for the program to run
In main.py, add your API key to the api variable

The formula:
This is built on the concept of progression of each champion and improving their spells.
The score is based on the rate in which the spells are cast and how much damage they can do. 
((((AD at 18 - AD at 1)/18) *(AttackRange/100))/((Attack Speed at 18 - Attack Speed at 1)/18)) + ((((AP at 18 - AP at 1)/18)/((energy cost at 18 - energy cost at 1)/18))*((mgregen at 18 - mgregen at 1)/18))

The program does not completely take in all game variables such as items, your runes, and your skills
